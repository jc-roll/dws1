 	 <h1><strong>Beach Volleyball</strong></h1>
  		<p> Beach Volleyball began in the early 1920s. Most accounts place the sport's origin in Santa Monica, California, where the first Volleyball courts were put up on the beach at the Playground (Santa Monica). Families played 6 vs 6. As time has passed the sport has evolved into an Olympic sport. In the Olympic's the teams are divided in to teams of 2 v 2.</p>
